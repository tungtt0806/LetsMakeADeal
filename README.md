# LetsMakeADeal
Let's Make A Deal game, using C# to program.
The player chooses a Door and the prize inside that door is revealed. The player can then keep that prize or be given the choice to choose another Door. Do not show the items under the other doors. If they choose another Door, the player gets to keep the prize inside that door.
Set Up:
1) "Door #1",  "Door #2" and  "Door #3."

2) While choosing the prizes, make sure get three grades of quality.

3) Place one prize of each type under the boxes without anyone seeing it. You do not have to put the REALLY COOL prize in Door #1 because you don't want your players to figure out a pattern.

4) When the player finishes the game either play a celebratory sound and flash winner on the screen or a loser sound and you lost message on the screen.
